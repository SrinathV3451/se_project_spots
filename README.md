# Project Spot

This is the third project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project description 

Spots is a responsive web application that showcases a profile and a curated gallery of cards displaying favorite locations. Designed for seamless viewing across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices, the application adapts dynamically to the user's screen size. Users can browse through images of different spots, view a user profile, and experience an intuitive layout optimized for all devices.

   ### Functionalities
   Displays a user profile with a profile picture, name, and role. Includes an "Edit Profile" button for potential future functionality. Features a responsive grid of cards, each containing an image and description of a location. Adapts the number of cards per row based on screen width:
   
   Desktop: 3 cards per row.
   Tablet: 2 cards per row.
   Mobile: 1 card per row.

   ### Technologies and Techniques

   1. HTML5: For semantic structure and content organization. 
   2. CSS3: For styling, including:
        Responsive design using media queries. 
        Grid layout for arranging the cards dynamically. 
        BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology for structuring CSS classes.
   3. Font Management: Using Google Fonts (Poppins) with custom @font-face declarations.
   4. CSS Normalize: Ensures consistent styling across different browsers.
   5. Responsive Design Techniques: Ensures the project is mobile-friendly, tablet-compatible, and desktop-optimized.
   6. File Structure: Organized using a clear and maintainable folder hierarchy for assets (e.g., fonts, images, and CSS files).
